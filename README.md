<h1 align="center">Pharmacy Shop Workload Management System 💊</h1> <br />

The development of Pharmacy Shop Workload Management System for ICT 2201 Introduction to Software Engineering group project.

## 📖 Background
Work-life balance has been a growing concern among employees, especially amongst the younger working population. As such, it is imperative to tackle the issues pertaining overworking, and we have thus planned to develop a web application that can help in ensuring an employee’s work-life balance, and prevent burnouts. 

On top of balancing work-life balance, the system also makes the lives of those in charge of the staff roster to be much easier as well. At a glance, the administrative manager will be able to easily see who amongst their staff are available for rostering. Instead of the traditional word-of-mouth rostering, in which a staff will relay their availability to their superiors verbally or via text, they will instead indicate them on our system. The administrative manager will then be shown visually which staff he/she can assign for a given working day rather than manually matching, thus improving productivity.

In the pharmacy shop, Administrative managers would assign jobs to staff based on the availability that they have indicated, which includes the days and shifts they would prefer as well as their branch preference. The monthly roster is dependent on the staff availability. Staff would be required to tell the Administrative managers before the deadline set each week, if not no jobs would be assigned to them.  Any late request by the staff would risk the chance of not being taken into consideration when planning for next week's schedule.
